# Puffin-Climate-Model

This model simulates the effects of global warming and other human disturbances on the habitat and food supply of puffins.
Examples included in the model are fish swimming north to escape rising ocean temperatures, boats disturbing islands, and conservation efforts to maintain the puffin population.
This model was inspired by the work of the Audubon Society on Eastern Egg Rock in Maine, where puffins have successfully been reintroduced.
